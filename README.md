# Premier_League_2020-21_EDA
This is an exploratory data analysis project using Python and SQL using data about player statistics that played in the Premier League in the 2020/21 season

I have included the csv file that was used to read and manipulate the data. The PL_Queries.sql has the SQL code that I used to query the premier league data to find answers to interesting questions. The IPYNB file contains the Python code I used to analyse and perform visualisations based on the premier league data.

I created a breif dashboard using TABLEAU for some of the results and insights that I found intriguing. I queried the data using SQL and saved the results in an Excel file which I was then able to use in TABLEAU to create a dashboard. The link for this dashboard is as follows: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/veer1463/viz/PremierLeagueAnalysis_16327576448210/Dashboard1
